# Online-Retail-Customer-
Overview: This dataset gives us a big-picture view of how customers interact with an online retail store. The main goal here is to predict when customers might stop shopping at this store.
if Target_Churn is True, it's like a warning sign that the customer might leave the store soon. The store can then use this information to take actions, like offering discounts or promotions, to try and keep the customer from leaving.
